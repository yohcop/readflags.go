This package reads files formatted like:

----
# This is a comment
# This includes the defaults.txt file which can define some flags too.
%include defaults.txt

# Define some flags here
a_flag = flag_value
port = 8080

# Override more flags with this file.
%include override.txt
----

Basically, 3 types of lines:
- Starting with '#' are comments
  Ignored.
- Starting with '%' are commands
  - The only command right no is 'include'. It reads the given file.
    The path is relative to the file containing the command.
    This only works when ReadFlagsFromFile is used.
- flag = value
  Sets the flag 'flag' to the given value


There are 3 exported functions:
- ReadFlags
- ReadFlagsFromFile
- ReadFlagsFromString

As previously mentioned, only ReadFlagsFromFile reads the
%include command correctly, as it does not makes sence when
read from a string, or a io.Reader.

Usage is hopefuly self explanatory. The only thing you should be
careful with, is the order of calls. you should probably call ReadFlags*
functions before calling flags.Parse(), to let users override flags via command
line.
